# Weather-App

This project is a weather application created using HTML/CSS & JavaScript.
The project was completed as part of the Odin Project full-stack JavaScript course with the main objective of the project being the use of asynchronous code using fetch and async/await to retrieve weather data.

The application allows the user to enter the name of a city of their choice and then fetches that data and displays it to the user in various forms.
Firstly, the name of the city and its country are displayed along with the current date. The current weather conditions are then displayed along with the temperature and 3 different metrics namely current windspeed, rainfall and humidity.
The user is also provided with the weather forecast for each hour of the current day along with the forecasted temperature and chance of rain.
Lastly, the user is also given a forecast for the next 5 days aswell as information on the high and low temperatures on that day, the maximum windspeed and chance of rain on those days aswell.
